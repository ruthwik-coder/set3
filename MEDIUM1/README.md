---

## 🔨 Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality

```python
# Your script should be runnable like this:
python db_analyzer.py --db data.db --email recipient@example.com
```

### Suggested Libraries

```python
import sqlite3           # Database connection
import pandas as pd      # Data analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Visualizations
import seaborn as sns    # Advanced visualizations
import smtplib           # Email sending
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.image import MIMEImage
```

### Database Analysis Steps

1. **Discover Schema**
```python
# Get list of tables
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

# Get column info for each table
cursor.execute(f"PRAGMA table_info({table_name});")
```

2. **Extract Data**
```python
# Use pandas for easy analysis
df = pd.read_sql_query(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}", conn)
```

3. **Generate Statistics**
```python
# Basic stats
df.describe()
df.info()
df.isnull().sum()
```

4. **Create Visualizations**
```python
# Examples:
- Bar chart of counts
- Line chart of trends
- Pie chart of distributions
- Heatmap of correlations
```

## ⚙️ Email Configuration

**SMTP Settings** (will be provided during event):
```python
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"  # Example
SMTP_PORT = 587
SENDER_EMAIL = "provided@event.com"
SENDER_PASSWORD = "will_be_provided"
```

**Important**:
- Email credentials will be shared during the event
- Use environment variables or config file (not hardcode)
- Test with your own email first

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
cd medium
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn sqlite3
```

### Step 2: Explore Database

```bash
# Open database in SQLite browser or Python
sqlite3 data.db
.tables
.schema table_name
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Analysis

1. What tables exist?
2. What relationships are there?
3. What questions can the data answer?
4. What visualizations make sense?

### Step 4: Build and Test

1. Write database exploration code
2. Generate sample visualizations
3. Format report
4. Test email sending (to yourself first)
