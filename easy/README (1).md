# AI CODEFIX 2025 - Easy Challenge
## Navigate Namma Bengaluru (Bangalore Wumpus World)

---

## Problem Statement

You are required to implement an **A\* pathfinding algorithm** for a Bangalore-themed variant of the classic Wumpus World. The agent must navigate a 5×10 grid filled with real-world Bangalore obstacles to reach the goal safely. The agent must take all the environmental elements into account(this includes the cell costs) to find the optimal path to the goal cell.

---

## World Description

### Grid Layout
- **Size:** 5 rows × 10 columns
- **Agent Start:** Bottom-left diagonal cell (0, 4)
- **Goal:** Randomly placed (varies per team based on seed)

### Environmental Elements

| Element | Percept | Effect |cost|
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Traffic Light** | Adjacent cells detect "light" indicator | Wait cost → passable but slower   |20|
| **Cow** | Adjacent cells detect "moo" sound | Adjacent cell has cow →If  mark as forbidden → return to start → re-compute A* |10|
| **Pit** | Adjacent cells detect "breeze" | **Game Over** if entered, Adjacent cells are risky → high cost, avoid unless necessary|infinite|
| **Goal** | No percept | **Win** if reached |-|

---

## What's Already Implemented ✅

The starter code (`wumpus_world.py`) provides:

- ✅ Pygame visualization of 5×10 grid
- ✅ Randomized weights of each grid 
- ✅ Random world generation (using your team's unique seed)
- ✅ Percept detection system (breeze, moo, light)
- ✅ Traffic light delay mechanism (nested loop)
- ✅ Cow collision → reset to start
- ✅ Pit detection → Game Over
- ✅ Game state management

## What You Must Implement 🔨

### Task: Complete the `find_path_astar()` function

**Location:** `wumpus_world.py`, line ~170

**Requirements:**

1. **Implement A\* pathfinding** from agent's current position to goal
2. **Movement rules:**
   - Only **orthogonal movement** (up, down, left, right)
   - **NO diagonal movement allowed**
3. **Handle obstacles:**
   - **Pits:** Must avoid completely (entering = Game Over)
   - **Traffic Lights:** Can pass through but cost more (suggest cost = 5)
   - **Cows:** Strategy choice:
     - Option: Handle collision and replan from start and mark path as unusable. Use a different path.
4. **Return value:**
   - List of (x, y) tuples representing path
   - Example: `[(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), ...]`
   - Return `None` if no path exists

## Algorithm Hints

### A\* Formula
```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```
- **g(n)** = actual cost from start to node n(Assume the randomized weights to be the actual costs)
- **h(n)** = heuristic estimate from n to goal (use Manhattan distance)
- **f(n)** = total estimated cost

### Cost Function
```python
 import random

def get_cell_cost(x, y):
    cell_type = self.grid[y][x]['type']

    if cell_type == 'pit':
        return float('inf')        # avoid pits completely
    elif cell_type == 'traffic_light':
        return 20                  
    elif cell_type == 'cow':
        return 10                  
    else:
        return self.grid[y][x]['weight']  # random cost ONLY for normal cells

```

### Manhattan Distance Heuristic
```python
def heuristic(pos, goal):
    return abs(pos[0] - goal[0]) + abs(pos[1] - goal[1])
```

### Key Considerations

⚠️ **No Diagonal Movement**
- When generating neighbors, only use: `[(0,-1), (0,1), (-1,0), (1,0)]`
- Do NOT use diagonal directions like `(1,1)` or `(-1,-1)`

⚠️ **Cow Collision Handling**
- If your path crosses a cow, the agent resets to start
- You need to either:
  - Detect collision and replan from start position

⚠️ **Path Not Found**
- If no valid path exists, set `self.message = "Path Not Found"`
- Return `None`

## How to Run

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python wumpus_world.py
```

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys:** Manual movement (you are allowed to use manual movements for testing,however the final solution must be automated)
- **SPACE:** Execute A\* pathfinding (once implemented)
- **R:** Reset world with same seed
- **ESC:** Quit

---

## Testing Your Solution

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Path:** Can agent reach goal on empty grid?
2. **Avoid Pits:** Does A\* route around pits correctly?
3. **Traffic Lights:** Does path account for traffic light costs?
4. **No Path:** Does it return "Path Not Found" when goal is unreachable?
5. **Cow Handling:** What happens if only path includes a cow?

### Expected Output
When you press **SPACE**, you should see:
```
=== Executing A* Pathfinding ===
Path found: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), ...]
(0,4): f(n)= g(n) +h(n)= 10+300=310
....
```
Agent should then automatically navigate to the goal.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] `find_path_astar()` function fully implemented
- [ ] A\* algorithm correctly uses Manhattan distance heuristic
- [ ] No diagonal movement in path
- [ ] Pits are avoided (never entered)
- [ ] Traffic lights handled (higher cost or proper logic)
- [ ] Cow collision strategy decided and implemented
- [ ] "Path Not Found" message displayed when no path exists
- [ ] Agent successfully reaches goal when path exists

## Debugging Tips

### Print Debugging
Add these to understand your A\* logic:
```python
print(f"Current node: {current}")
print(f"Goal: {goal}")
print(f"f_score[current]: {f_score[current]}")
print(f"Neighbors: {neighbors}")
```

### Visualize Open Set
```python
print(f"Open set size: {len(open_set)}")
print(f"Visited nodes: {len(visited)}")
```

### Check Path Validity
```python
for step in path:
    cell_type = self.grid[step[1]][step[0]]['type']
    print(f"{step} -> {cell_type}")
```

## FAQs

**Q: Can I use libraries like `heapq` for priority queue?**
A: Yes! Python's `heapq` is perfect for A\*.

**Q: What if multiple paths have same cost?**
A: Any valid optimal path is acceptable.

**Q: Should I avoid cows or handle reset?**
A: Your choice! Both strategies are valid if implemented correctly.

**Q: Can I modify other functions besides `find_path_astar()`?**
A: Yes, but document your changes clearly.

**Q: How do I know my team's unique configuration?**
A: Check `team_config.json` - each team has a different seed.
